# Portfolio 2

Part of three portfolios developed for a university assignment to evaluate the UI and UX of modern web design trends. Each portfolio has three sections, about, projects, and experiments. All three portfolios created contain the same information (text, images, icons, etc) as each other to keep the UX and UI of each site the primary focus of evaluation.

### Portfolio 2's key properties 

- Persistent and reactive navbar to serve as the only navigation.
- Multi-page with limited scrolling capabilities.
- Heavy utilisation of page transitions and animations.
- Flat, high contrast black/white colour scheme.
